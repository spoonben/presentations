# The ABCs of Programming


## A script is a series of instructions
* Recipe
* Handbook
* Story


## Recipe
* Just like recipes, script can be very simple, or very complicated
* There are A LOT of new terms to learn


## Handbook
* Like a handbook, scripts can guide users to do certain things in different situations
* Same situation, different people, different results. 
* Prepare for almost everything 


## Story
* Scripts can be linear
* But they can also be very indirect
* Depends on the complexity of the script


## Writing a Script
1. Define a goal
2. Design the script
3. Code each step


## Define a goal
What is the puzzle you are trying to solve?


## Design the script
Don't just start programming, as tempting as it is.

## Translate
* **Vocabulary** - The words a computer can understand 
* **Syntax** - How you put those words together to create instructions a computer can follow


## Think about our form

## What is our goal?



## How do we do that?


## Overview
* A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow in order to achieve a goal
* Each time a script runs, it might only user a subset of the instructions
* Computers are dumb, the need to solve issues programmatically 
* To achieve a goal, break it down into each step you need to accomplish
